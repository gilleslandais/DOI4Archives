# Citation requirements

(I am clearly not the best person to propose that, but I give here some of my understanding)

Citation requires metadata to be serialized in bibtex, APA, ADS, etc.
The content of metadata depend of the serialisation and of the need of quality (bibtex generated by ADS is more rich than those provided by DataCite)
We will describe the mandatory items that cover the known citations and we will complete the metadata with added relevant information.

The above list of metadata are mandatory to respond to the different citation:
- identifier
- link to the dataset or landing page
- title
- year of publication
- complete authors list and possible contributors
(to complete)

See in section ?? to get more information

**Note**: DataCite provides different format that allows to check different citation output.
 
eg: ```curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://doi.org/10.5270/esa-1ugzkg7```

## Full Bibtex template
 the following example map bibtex with DataCite schema.

```
@dataset{{localref},
	author = {{authors},
	title = {title},
	year = {year},
	month = {month},
	eid = {usualName},
	url = {url},
	keywords = {keywords},
	publisher = {publisherName},
	copyright = {rights},
	DOI = {DOI}
}
```

Equivalent in APA style:
```
{authors} ({year}). {title} [Data set]. {publisher}. {DOI}
```
VizieR example: (catalogue J/MNRAS/320/451)
```

## Evloving Datasets

see [DataCite evolving datasets](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.6/guidance/dynamic-datasets/)

We distinguish different ways for Citing evolving datasets. The method depends on the data Center implementation.

1. Cite a snapshot of the Dataset. In this approach, the Data Center make snapshot an adopts a versioning mechanism.
2. Cite the dataset as to be an evolving Dataset.
    Example in APA style:
    ```
    {authors} ({year}). {title} [evolving Data set]. {publisher}. {DOI}. Accessed {date_of_access}
    ```
    In the example {date_of_access} could be the 'upodate' date of the DOI record (supposing that the dataset and its DOI recors are well synchronised).

3. Cite a sub part of a DataSet resulting of a query. 
   The solution to these problems can become complex if we take into account the reproducibility.
  A simple solution which does not take reproducibility into account consists to cite the access protocol (for example scs, TAP), optionaly completed with query details.

    Example in APA style: (note that ```protocol``` is independent of the DOI record!
    ```

  A more advanced option, that take into account the reproducibility has been adopted by the VAMDC Query Store wher both: query and result are hosted with a DOI (giving details are not in the scope of this note).

    {authors} ({year}). {title} [evolving Data set]. {publisher}. {DOI}. Accesses {date_of_access}, via {protocol}
    ```
