# Identifier for project
At the time of writing, RAID (Research Activity Identifier) is new in
the open DATA scene. We do not have feedbacks to provide any best prac-
tice. However, an agreement between the RAID maintenance organisation
(Australian Research Data Commons) and DataCite makes possible to gen-
erate such identifiers from DOIs (using DataCite:resourceTypeGeneral
"Project")
