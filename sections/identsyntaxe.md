# The DOI syntaxe
The DOI syntax is composed with a prefix followed by a suffix.
The prefix is assigned by DataCite or CrossRef and is used for all resources provided by the DOI producer. The suffix is created by the producer to identify the resource.

For instance : 
```
https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/aab76a

- the prefix 10.3847 is the prefix attributed by CrossRef to the AAS journals 
- the suffix 1538-4365/aab76a defined the article and 

```

DataCite recommends using an opaque syntaxe. To remove any significance
in a name avoids bad interpretation and is more sustainable. For example,
the data center where the data are deposited may change and therefore
should not be used in the syntax.

Note also the recomendation for the use of DOIs in a web page is that they are clickable links. It is therefore up to the publisher whether or not to hide the DOI link with appropriate text.
